					<p><strong>What is this?</strong> This is a fast, easy, and completely secure way to produce hash files
						compatible with Well &amp; Lighthouse clients. Itâ€™s an application that runs locally on your device,
						compatible with most operating systems. Simply select the file you want to hash, pick the
						appropriate fields to encrypt, and hit go. And most importantly -- your data is secure and
						completely your own. Data is encrypted and saved locally, and is never sent anywhere without your consent.</p>
